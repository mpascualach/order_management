4. Database: Use database of your choice and utilize the vector database like Chroma DB for pdfs.
5. Deployment: Containerize the application using Docker
6. Testing: Implement unit tests for key components

The candidate should:

1. Provide a high-level design of the system.
2. Implement key components (e.g., prompt engineering, a simple frontend component)
3. Explain their choice of technologies and potential scalability considerations.
4. Discuss how they would integrate this system with existing BASF infrastructure.
